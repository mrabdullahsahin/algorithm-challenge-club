## **Algorithm Challenge Club**

The algorithm is a study of the problems and the solutions to these problems.
In this study for the following languages will be used;
* Swift
* Java
* Javascript

## **Update**

`v1.0.0`
* [added] Add to Github.
* [added] Add to one algorithm challenge.

## **Algorithm Challenges**

### 1) Missing and find out more.
> * N pieces are given a list of integers. This list of numbers up to N 1, one missing, someone goes and goes behind twice exactly once. <br><br>Task: Find the missing twice and last elements.
<br>

> Swift [Solution](https://github.com/mrabdullahsahin/algorithm-challenge-club/tree/master/1/Swift/MyPlayground.playground) |
<br>
> Other Solution Coming Soon..

### 2) Two Sum
> * Given an array of integers, of the result such that they add up to a specific target. <br> You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
<br><br>

> * Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9 <br> Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9 <br>
